    m_Localized: "Jump higher and higher by strategically utilizing the floating
      platforms that are scattered throughout the space all around you. You will
      bounce automatically upon landing and must move either left or right in order
      to successfully land on the platforms positioned directly above you. If you
      happen to miss a platform entirely and fall past the bottom edge of the screen,
      or alternatively, if you collide with a UFO either from its bottom or from
      its side, it's immediately game over. Your primary goal is simply to go as
      high as you possibly can so as to achieve the absolute highest score possible.
      You will need to use your designated left/right movement keys (the Left/Right
      Arrows or the keys selected in the Settings menu) in order to carefully move
      toward your upcoming landing platforms. You carry along with you a rocket designed
      for vertical boosting. If it happens to contain any fuel whatsoever, hold down
      the Boost key (the Up Arrow or the key selected in Settings) in order to fly
      powerfully upward. To refuel your rocket tank, you must jump into fuel tanks
      that periodically spawn on certain specific platforms. While boosting, your
      precious fuel drains away at a constant, steady rate, but it is important to
      note that each and every time you activate a boost, it will consume at least
      10% of your total rocket tank capacity. If you start boosting with less than
      10% fuel remaining, then all of that remaining fuel will be completely used
      up. You can effectively use rocket boosts in critical moments to correct missed
      landings or potentially reach higher ledges that seem out of normal jumping
      range. Platforms themselves come in three distinct varieties: Green platforms:
      These are static and permanent; Red platforms: These break immediately after
      a single landing and can consequently only be used just the one time; Purple
      platforms: These steadily move left and right at a constant pace; White Platforms:
      You are not able to jump on them. UFOs slowly hover downward, all the while
      following your horizontal position. Before one actually appears visibly on
      your screen, you will see an arrow displayed at the top of the screen which
      serves to warn you clearly of the precise horizontal direction it's coming
      from. Colliding with one from below or the side ends your run immediately.
      However, you possess three distinct ways available to eliminate them: Laser
      Shot: Simply click the left mouse button pointed toward your target. A laser
      beam then fires instantly from your current position in the cursor\u2019s direction
      and will destroy a UFO if it successfully gets hit; Stomp Attack: Jump directly
      on top of a UFO in order to destroy it.. You\u2019ll bounce off as if you had
      just landed on a standard platform; Rocket Boost: Use an active rocket boost
      to destroy any UFO you collide with while you are thrusting powerfully upward.
      After scoring 400 points or more, you will subsequently unlock an automatic
      starting boost that becomes available on your very next run, which essentially
      launches you upward to a height equivalent to 50% of your previous best score.
      You can easily toggle this particular feature either on or off later on within
      the Settings menu. The entire game can be conveniently paused at any time whatsoever
      by clicking the pause button located in the top-left corner of the screen or
      alternatively by pressing the designated Pause key (default: Spacebar). During
      an active game session, you will consistently find on the right side of the
      screen, the following key information displayed: Jump Counter: This shows how
      often you bounced in the current game; High Score: This displays the best height
      score you\u2019ve ever managed to reach; Total Boost Distance: This shows how
      much you boosted in the current game; Fuel Amount: This clearly indicates your
      remaining rocket fuel level; Horizontal Position: This show your real-time
      horizontal position; Current Score: This shows your real-time height score;
      Destroyed UFO Counter: This shows how many UFOs you have destroyed in the current
      game. You can always open up the Settings menu directly from the Main Menu
      in order to accomplish several tasks: Choose the preferred language for all
      of the on-screen texts, separately adjust the volume levels of both the music
      and the sound effects, customize the specific key bindings used for left movement,
      right movement, boosting and pause functions, and additionally, enable or disable
      both the automatic start boost feature as well as the display of in-game tips.\r"
